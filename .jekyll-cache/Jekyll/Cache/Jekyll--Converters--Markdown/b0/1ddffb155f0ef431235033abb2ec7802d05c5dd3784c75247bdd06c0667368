I"h<p>Hey there friends! It’s time for another salmon bagel review. Today I sampled the Smoked Salmon Bagel from Earth’s Harvest in Dover, NH.</p>

<p>On the whole, Earth’s Harvest has a high quality and intriguing menu for Dover, if a bit expensive. The virtue of a Banh Mi sandwich is that it’s a cheap yummy bite…not a $15 luxury.</p>

<p>If you take a gander at my receipt, you won’t see the price for a Smoked Salmon Bagel from Earth’s Harvest, but I’ll simply tell you that it was $12. That’s to say, close to 50% more than our friends over at Bubby’s. One could get 3 Lox Sandwiches at Bubby’s for only a few more shekels than 2 Smoked Salmon Bagels at Earth’s Harvest….</p>

<p>Another thing - our previous two review have been for lox bagels whereas this is smoked salmon. Both smoked salmon and lox are both cured or brined, but as the name suggests, smoked salmon is then smoked afterwards.</p>

<p>The sandwich doesn’t have a generous portion of salmon, but it also doesn’t skimp out. The sandwich includes cream cheese, capers, and onion. I actually think it’s pretty well balenced</p>

<p>The sandwich itself is pretty good. I don’t think any one ingredient stood out particularly. The portion sizes were appropriate and contributed to the balance of the sandwich. I’ve certainly had a sandwich before that is so loaded that half the filling spills out while eating. That wasn’t an issue here. The salmon wasn’t overpowering, but blended in nicely, and was contrasted by the brine and sharpness of the capers and onion. I got mine on a sesame bagel, which  seems to be a pattern for me - maybe in future reviews I’ll try poppyseed. The bagel was actually toasted nicely. The inside of the bagel was soft and flexible, contrasting well with the crispy exterior.</p>

<p>Overall, a very nice sandwich. That seems it should be a given for a place called Loxsmith Bagels. I would certainly order it again.</p>
