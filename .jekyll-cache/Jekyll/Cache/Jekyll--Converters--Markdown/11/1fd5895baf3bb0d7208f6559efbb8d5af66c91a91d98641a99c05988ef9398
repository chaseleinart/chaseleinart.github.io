I"Ë<p>Hey there friends! Itâ€™s time for another salmon bagel review. I visited Seattle last week for work, with the great fortune of sampling at least one salmon bagel in the city. Iâ€™ve been to Seattle before, and appreciate their exceedingly high quality of salmon, but failed to anticipate the impact that would have on a sandwich. Itâ€™s obvious though, that if you have a meal composed of few ingredients, the quality of each ingredient is paramount.</p>
