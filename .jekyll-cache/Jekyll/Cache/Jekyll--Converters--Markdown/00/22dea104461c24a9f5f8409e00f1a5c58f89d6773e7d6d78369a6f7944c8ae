I"∫	<p>Hey there friends! It‚Äôs time for another salmon bagel review. I visited Seattle last week for work, with the great fortune of sampling at least one salmon bagel in the city. I‚Äôve been to Seattle before, and appreciate their exceedingly high quality of salmon, but failed to anticipate the impact that would have on a sandwich. It‚Äôs obvious though, that if you have a meal composed of few ingredients, the quality of each ingredient is paramount.</p>

<p>Frolik is a restaurant situated on the fifth floor of the Motif hotel in Seattle. The Motif greatly annoyed me by forcing me to wait an hour for my reserved room - even after the check-in time. Thankfully, their food offerings were able to assuage my anger. As you might expect, Seattle is more expensive than the New Hampshire Seacost in basically every definable dimension, with the possible exception of lobster rolls. Thankfully, I didn‚Äôt find any and therefore wasn‚Äôt forced to consider how they would have made it to the PNW. $17 would be a very expensive salmon bagel in NH, but I think it was justified.</p>

<p>I elected to choose the eponymous ‚Äúworks‚Äù bagel, which seemed to include sesame, salt, poppyseed, and garlic, but I wouldn‚Äôt stake my life on that assessment.</p>

<p>This one had the interesting usage of veggie creamcheese, which may not be standard, but I think was actually quite pleasant in the context of a works bagel sandwich.</p>

<p>I wish I had taken more photos, but I ate this one on my lunch break and was in a hurry. Nevertheless, I felt compelled to write this review for my people. The toppings included red onion, capers, and tomato, as well as some superb smoked salmon. The Works Cafe website indicates that their salmon is ‚Äúcold-smoked‚Äù. I couldn‚Äôt tell you whether that genuinely impacts the final product, but I was a great fan of their salmon. Perhaps the only detraction would be that the bagel was toasted just barely beyond my preference. Ironic given our last review‚Äôs detraction for an untoasted bagel.</p>

<h1 id="rating-88100">Rating: 88/100</h1>

<p>Very well-made sandwich with great balance of toppings and great salmon. Were the bagel toasted just a tad less, it would have been nearly perfect. Still, an excellent and different sandwich.</p>
