I"k<p>In the novel series A Song of Ice And Fire and its television adaption Game of Thrones, some characters are gifted with the ability to enter the minds of animals and control them. These people are referred to as skinchangers. A subset of those who control wolves are known as “wargs”.</p>

<p>As a noun, warg was introduced to modern English by J.R.R Tolkien as a learned borrowing from the Old Norse word “vargr”, meaning broadly wolf, evildoer, or destroyer. Tolkien introduced the word in the context of The Hobbit as a race of evil wolves.</p>

<p>“Every now and then all the Wargs in the circle would answer their grey chief all together, and their dreadful clamour almost made the hobbit fall out of his pine-tree.”</p>

<p>Tolkien was a scholar of Old Norse and Old English and many placenames and concepts in his works are inspired from the literature and lexicon of those languages. A well known example of this includes “middle-earth”, the continent that the events of the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings take place.</p>

<p>Amusingly, as a scholar of Old English, Tolkien would have likely been aware of the existence of an Old English cognate to “warg” in the form of “wearg”</p>

<p>/wæ͜ɑrɡ/, [wæ͜ɑrˠɣ]</p>

<p>In Old English, the wolf meaning as found in Old Norse is absent, with a more general sense of a criminal or evil spirit/ creature. Below are some usages found in several Old English homilies:</p>

<p>Wearh hangian, fægere ongildan þæt he ær facen dyde manna cynne. ― The criminal shall hang, paying fairly for the crime he committed against the race of men. (Maxims II)</p>

<p>Wearh sceal hangian, fægere ongildan ðæt hé ǽr fácen dyde manna cynne,</p>

<p>This serves as a good example of one of the most easily observable phonological changes that happened during the evolution of the English language: palatization of velar stops. In English, the velar stops /k ɡ/ and the consonant cluster /sk/ were palatalized in certain cases and became the sounds /tʃ/, /dʒ/, /j/, and /ʃ/.</p>

<p>For example, final -y in English often comes from an older -ig (and there is often a current German cognate that ends in -ig)  all /g/’s before front vowels were shifted to /j/ (spelled y),</p>

<p>In “wearg” or “wearh”, the g or h are allophonic and pronounced as a voiced velar fricative or voiceless palatal fricative.</p>

<p>We can see evidence of this in some examples below:</p>

<p>Old English -&gt; Modern English
handġeweorc -&gt; handiwork
dæg         -&gt; day</p>

<p>As part of this phonological change, Old English wearg became weari in Middle English. This word doesn’t appear to have survived into modern English, but leads us to work backwords for the modern near-homophone weary.</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, looking back to Old English, we find the root as wēriġ, from Proto-Germanic  *wōrīgaz.</p>

<p>From Ancrene Riwle: 
c1230(?a1200) Ancr.(Corp-C 402)180/6 : Ich am unwurð hire as weari [Cai: wari; Nero: weri; Pep: þef] þe is ahonget.</p>
