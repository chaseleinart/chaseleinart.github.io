I"•<p>Hey there guys, gals, and even you non-binary pals! After 10 months, itâ€™s time for another salmon bagel review. In that time, I have eaten at a few of the NH Seacoast locations Iâ€™ve already reviewed, but hadnâ€™t yet scoped out any new local eats. Iâ€™m happy to report that Iâ€™ve recently learned of several additional spots in the area that Iâ€™ll work on and document it for your pleasure.</p>
