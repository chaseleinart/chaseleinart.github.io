I"Ê<p>Hey there guys, gals, and even you non-binary pals! After 10 months, itâ€™s time for another salmon bagel review. In that time, I have eaten at a few of the NH Seacoast locations Iâ€™ve already reviewed, but hadnâ€™t yet scoped out any new local eats. Iâ€™m happy to report that Iâ€™ve recently learned of several additional spots in the area that Iâ€™ll work on and document it for your pleasure.</p>

<p>Hey there folks,</p>

<p>A little over a week after the last review, I had the pleasure of stopping into Providence Bagel in Kingston, RI. I notice that the visit marked exactly 1 year since the first salmon bagel I reviewed! I originally made chaseleinart.com to act as a tech and linguistics blog, but found myself without any immediate ideas. Not wanting to waste a perfectly good domain, I started posting content for another favorite in my life, salmon on bagels. I recently learned about a few new localish spots, so Iâ€™ll be visiting them shortly.</p>

<p>I was staying near Kingston, RI for the 2023 Viola da Gamba Society of America Conclave. I play several musical instruments with varying proficiency: the cello, bass guitar, double bass, and mandolin. I was already familiar with viols as a cousin to the violin family, and learned of an annual gathering for viols not too far from my home. I</p>

<p>Stroll is not a new <em>restaurant</em> for me, but I was <em>completely</em> unaware that they offered a smoked salmon bagel. Iâ€™ve been to Stroll a number of times and am always made happy by their pastries, soups, drinks, and more. Of course I <em>had</em> to try their smoked salmon bagel after hearing about it.</p>

<p>Salmon, Cream Cheese, Red Onion, and Capers on a Bagel..doesnâ€™t get much better than that. There were several bagel types available, but I decided that an everything bagel would be my best choice. I was actually quite pleased with the price of $9.95, which is about as good as it gets in the New Hampshire Seacoast as of 2023.</p>

<p>Note the rather large cuts of salmon hanging outside of the bagel. The bagel itself was very well toasted. Just a bit crisp on the outside, with the soft interior allowing some give during a bite.</p>

<p>The ingredients were very well balanced. The red onion was very cut into very thin slivers which blended in with the other components. The onion itself offered a surprising sweetness that complemented the smokiness of the salmon. Speaking of, the salmon was smokier than many Iâ€™ve eaten on a bagel before. Iâ€™ll assume it was hot-smoked rather than cold-smoked. Much of the salmon Iâ€™ve eaten on a bagel has been cold-smoked, which leaves the salmon brighter and fresher, pairing nicely with capers and raw red onion. In this case, the salmon was very smoky, which married well with the very prominent toasted garlic flavor on the everything bagel as well as the slight sweetness of the red onion. Although the salmon flavor profile (i know that sounds pretentious, but I donâ€™t have a better word) differed from many other salmon and lox bagels Iâ€™ve eaten, it was a welcome change of pace. If you canâ€™t tell from the image below, I was very pleased to dig into this one and would recommend it for anyone.</p>
