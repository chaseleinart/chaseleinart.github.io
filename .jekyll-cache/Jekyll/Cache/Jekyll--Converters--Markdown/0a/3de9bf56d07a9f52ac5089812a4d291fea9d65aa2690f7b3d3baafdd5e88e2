I"^<p>Hey there guys, gals, and even you non-binary pals! After 10 months, it’s time for another salmon bagel review. In that time, I have eaten at a few of the NH Seacoast locations I’ve already reviewed, but hadn’t yet scoped out any new local eats. I’m happy to report that I’ve recently learned of several additional spots in the area that I’ll work on and document it for your pleasure.</p>

<p>Hey there folks,</p>

<p>A little over a week after the last review, I had the pleasure of stopping into Providence Bagel in Kingston, RI. I notice that the visit marked exactly 1 year since the first salmon bagel I reviewed! I originally made chaseleinart.com to act as a tech and linguistics blog, but found myself without any immediate ideas. Not wanting to waste a perfectly good domain, I started posting content for another favorite in my life, salmon on bagels. I recently learned about a few new localish spots, so I’ll be visiting them shortly.</p>

<p>I was staying near Kingston, RI for the 2023 Viola da Gamba Society of America Conclave. I play several musical instruments with varying proficiency: the cello, bass guitar, double bass, and mandolin. I was already familiar with viols as a cousin to the violin family, and learned of an annual gathering for viols not too far from my home. The intro class was advertised as free for locals, so I couldn’t resist. I had a great time playing the instrument and intend to rent one, learning to play it further.</p>

<p>You’ll have to forive the poor image quality of the receipt, but the Class Lox sandwich came in at $9.99. Pretty reasonable by my standards.</p>

<p>I opted to get mine on poppyseed. It included cream cheese, white onion, red tomato, capers, and of course lox.</p>

<p>The best thing about this is the bagel itself. It’s truly fresh and fantastic. The outside is perfectly toasted, while the inside is very soft. The salmon is also fresh and very light in flavor. Ordinarily, I don’t think that tomatoes add too much to a salmon bagel, but in this case, they work pretty well with the white onion and capers. The onion wasn’t too overpowering and each bite had a nice little “pop” from the poppyseeds encrusted on the bagel. For 10 bucks, this is a great bagel. The salmon portion is plenty, but not overflowing. The superb quality of the bagel adds a point for me. I wish I could say more, but I’m writing this from some bullet points typed onto my phone while eating in my car. If you’re ever in the Providence area, I believe they have multiple locations. Highly recommended!</p>
