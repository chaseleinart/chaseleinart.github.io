I"$<p>Hey there guys, gals, and even you non-binary pals! After 10 months, it’s time for another salmon bagel review. In that time, I have eaten at some of the NH Seacoast locations I’ve already reviewed, but hadn’t yet scoped out any newlocally locations. I’m happy to report that I’ve recently learned of several additional spots in the area that I’ll get back to work on and document it for your pleasure.</p>

<p>Stroll is not a new <em>restaurant</em> for me, but I was <em>completely</em> unaware that they offered a smoked salmon bagel. I’ve been to Stroll a number of times and am always made happy by their pastries, soups, drinks, and more. Of course I <em>had</em> to try their smoked salmon bagel after hearing about it.</p>

<p>Salmon, Cream Cheese, Red Onion, and Capers on a Bagel..doesn’t get much better than that. There were several bagel types available, but I decided that an everything bagel would be my best choice. I was actually quite pleased with the price of $9.95, which is about as good as it gets in the New Hampshire Seacoast as of 2023.</p>

<p>I dunno if it’s obvious, but the amount of salmon provided was gargantuan. This necessitates that the bagel be eaten in two halves openface, not as a sandwich. The toppings were simple: heirloom tomato, whipped cream cheese, and red onion, with a lemon slice on the side.</p>

<p>It would be difficult for me to overstate how good this bagel was. The quality of the salmon was unmatched by literally anything I’ve ever had. Although I’ve never been to NYC, they claim the best bagels and/or lox bagels. With the supreme quality of PNW salmon, I have to wonder if that claim is with merit. I’ve never been to NYC, but I suspect although their bagels themselves may be top-notch, there is no comparison to this salmon. I found no need to use the provided lemon slice, because the salmon itself had a wonderful bright citrus flavor. The pickled red onion was perfect. Absolutely no sharp onion flavor, just fresh brine. Capers were notably absent, but entirely unnecessary. Each half of the bagel was piled with what would make a generous salmon portion for an entire sandwich. The bagel was perfectly toasted. A nice crisp exterior, but the bagel gives easily to a bite.</p>

<h1 id="rating-95100">Rating: 95/100</h1>

<p>I worry that I’ve set myself up for failure with this out of 100 scale, but we’ll keep it going for now. I reserve the right to rate over 100 if some divine bagel from the heavens reaches me, or may otherwise convert existing reviews to a leaderboard. For now, I’ll just state simply that this is the best salmon bagel I’ve ever had, and I weep for what missed opportunities may lie in Seattle. I will likely visit in the future and review other offerings at my next opportunity. For now, we’re back to the East Coast.</p>
