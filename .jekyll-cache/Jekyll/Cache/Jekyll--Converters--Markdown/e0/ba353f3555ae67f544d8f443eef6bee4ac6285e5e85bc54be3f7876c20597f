I"T<p>Hey you shitheads. I fucking love bagels with smoked salmon or lox. Maybe you think lox is the same thing, but you’re wrong. Go google it.</p>

<p>Anyway. I’m going to eat as many bagels with some type of salmon on them and write reviews on them.</p>

<p>My first review will be for the Lox Sandwich available at Bubby’s Bagels and Deli in Dover, NH. What can be said of Bubby’s? Well, they’re located inside the train station in Dover, NH. I personally think that’s pretty cool. They also have tasty rugelach, which I haven’t found anywhere else on the NH Seacoast.</p>

<p>If you take a gander at their menu, you’ll see that the Lox Sandwich comes in at $8.25. I don’t think that’s too bad for this type of sandwich these days.</p>

<p>Taking a look at the interior of the sandwich, you can see that the salmon portion you get is pretty generous. The sandwich includes cream cheese, tomato, capers, and onion. In my mind, that is the perfect set of toppings for a sandwich like this. Not too much - not too little.</p>

<p>The sandwich itself is great. The onion isn’t so strong as to skew the flavor profile, the capers add some nice brine, and the salmon has a bright taste. I got mine on a sesame bagel, which I think is a good choice. The bagel was toasted just the right amount. Not so little as to make me question whether they toasted it at all, and not so much as to make it crispy or crunchy.</p>

<p>I’ve had other lox/smoked salmon bagels in Dover, but haven’t reviewed them yet. I’ll cut to the chase and suggest that Bubby’s has my favorite in town, unless the others I intend to later review has since upped their game. Keep up the good work.</p>
