Hey there friends! It's time for another salmon bagel review. I've been busy recently and although I sampled 2 whole salmon bagels in the last few weeks, I didn't manage to write down my thoughts. This entry is dated 8/31/22, but I'm penning it now on 9/26. Hopefully the scant notes I cribbed a few weeks ago will be enough to make a worthwhile review. I sampled the Smoked Salmon Sandwich from the Works Cafe in Durham, NH. As far as I know, I've exhausted all my available Dover options for salmon on bagel, so I had to venture over to the nearby Durham for another bagel adventure.

If you take a gander at my receipt, you won't see the price for a Smoked Salmon Sandwich. I should have learned from recent experiences that takeout receipts don't always include line-item prices, but I payed a reasonable $9.99 for my sandwich. Not too shabby - only fifty cents more than our friends at Loxsmith in Dover charge for theirs.

I elected to choose the eponymous "works" bagel, which seemed to include sesame, salt, poppyseed, and garlic, but I wouldn't stake my life on that assessment.

This one had the interesting usage of veggie creamcheese, which may not be standard, but I think was actually quite pleasant in the context of a works bagel sandwich.

I wish I had taken more photos, but I ate this one on my lunch break and was in a hurry. Nevertheless, I felt compelled to write this review for my people. The toppings included red onion, capers, and tomato, as well as some superb smoked salmon. The Works Cafe website indicates that their salmon is "cold-smoked". I couldn't tell you whether that genuinely impacts the final product, but I was a great fan of their salmon. Perhaps the only detraction would be that the bagel was toasted just barely beyond my preference. Ironic given our last review's detraction for an untoasted bagel.


# Rating: 88/100

Very well-made sandwich with great balance of toppings and great salmon. Were the bagel toasted just a tad less, it would have been nearly perfect. Still, an excellent and different sandwich.
