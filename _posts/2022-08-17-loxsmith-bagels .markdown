Hey there folks. I'm back at the salmon bagel reviews again. This time, we're trying out "The Classic", the flagship bagel from the cleverly-named Loxsmith Bagel Co. in Dover, NH.

I live in walking distance from Loxsmith Bagels, so it's immediately appealing as a destination. I frankly haven't tried many things on their menu apart from the lox bagel, which is fine because that's what this is all about.

If you take a gander at my receipt, you'll see that The Classic will set you back $9.50. Maybe a little pricey in my opinion, but eating out in general is becoming much more costly, so hardly unexpected.

The sandwich doesn't have a generous portion of salmon, but it also doesn't skimp out. The sandwich includes cream cheese, capers, and onion. I actually think it's pretty well balenced

The sandwich itself is pretty good. I don't think any one ingredient stood out particularly. The portion sizes were appropriate and contributed to the balance of the sandwich. I've certainly had a sandwich before that is so loaded that half the filling spills out while eating. That wasn't an issue here. The salmon wasn't overpowering, but blended in nicely, and was contrasted by the brine and sharpness of the capers and onion. I got mine on a sesame bagel, which  seems to be a pattern for me - maybe in future reviews I'll try poppyseed. The bagel was actually toasted nicely. The inside of the bagel was soft and flexible, contrasting well with the crispy exterior.

Overall, a very nice sandwich. That seems it should be a given for a place called Loxsmith Bagels. I would certainly order it again.
